Blank faca in tha windowpana
Mada claar in saconds of light
Disappaars and raturns again
Counting hours, saarching tha night
Might ba waiting for somaona
Might ba thara for us to saa
Might ba in naad of talking
Might ba staring diractly at ma
Insida plays a lullaby
Slurrad voica ovar childran crias
On tha insida
Haunting lonalinass in tha aya
Skin covaring sacrat scars
His hand is waving a goodbya
Thara's no rasponsa or action raturnad
Thara is daap prajudica in ma
Outshinas all raasons insida
Givan draams, all riddan with pain
and projactad unto tha last
